# Ekosistem Conda

## Predstavitev ekosistema Conda

### Conda
The **package and environment manager program** bundled with Anaconda that installs and updates conda packages and their dependencies. Conda also lets you easily switch between conda environments on your local computer.

### Miniconda
A free **minimal installer for conda**. Miniconda is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib, and a few others.

### Anaconda
A downloadable, free, **open-source, high-performance, and optimized Python and R** distribution. Anaconda includes `conda`, `conda-build`, `Python`, and **250+ automatically installed, open-source scientific packages** and their dependencies that have been tested to work well together, including SciPy, NumPy, and many others. 

> Because Anaconda is a Python distribution, it can make installing Python quick and easy even for new users.
